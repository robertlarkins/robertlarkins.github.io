## Why write instruction docs

I like writing instruction docs for myself. I have a shocking memory for remembering how to do things, particularly technical things that I touch infrequently. So I write instructions for myself. It might sound selfish, but when writing I'm generally not writing to benefit somebody else. If others benefit (which often occurs) then that is an added benefit. Writing instructions helps ingrain the steps, so I remember better, and writing (when thinking in terms of somebody who knows new to this area) helps you think about what additional information and context is valuable. Especially for yourself when you look back at the docs in say a years time and lost all context. What information do you need to provide to get the context back, and get back up to the knowledge level you had previously as quickly as possible.

Writing gives me something I can refer back to when I inevitably forget certain steps. It also has the bonus of often being useful for others. Generally if you have questions about how to do something, or a gap in your knowledge, then others do as well. So while writing instructions, while they might show a lack of intimate knowledge, I have never regretted having them. And the act of writing further improves my writing. I've often found in software engineering the focus is on producing features and functionality, but poor or no accompanying documentation that really help convey how to use the features or use them effectively.

Anyway, all that is a long-winded way of saying it is time I should also do writing as a blog.
